# Intro_Java_Projects

The Java files within this repository were created for an intro to Java programming class. 

The first project (Race.java) focuses on a Tortoise and Hare race simulation where the user may determine the length of track. The first symbol to reach the end of the user-specified track length (H for hare, T for tortoise) wins the race. This program is rudimentary and was completed before OOP principles were introduced in the class.

The rest of the files belong to the second project where a game of Blackjack was programmed. OOP principles were utilized in the creation of this game. The user plays against a NPC character and can bet an x amount of money. Standard Blackjack game rules are implented. The game ends either when the user follows the prompt to exit the game or when the player runs out of money in their bank.
